00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.500
This blade has a dark past.

2
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.800
It has shed much innocent blood.

3
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.450
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

4
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.800
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

5
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.300
Thank you.

6
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.000
So...

7
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.800
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm searching for someone.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

10
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
A dragon.

11
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,750
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

12
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,870
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

13
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,500
We're almost done. Shhh...

14
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey, sit still.

15
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,250
Good night, Scales.

16
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,850
Get him, Scales! Come on!

17
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,250
Scales?

18
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah! Come on!
